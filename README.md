## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap v5.3.0




### What I learned

I was able to use the bootstrap library(more specifically, bootstrap cards library) for responsive web design together with css media query.


### Continued development

I wouldn't want to rely on bootstrap too much as trying more complex designs with regular css would allow for more flexibility in design. Although, bootstrap makes the design process much more faster in cases when you would like to focus on other development areas.
